# WebDirectory
WebDirectory is a project designed as both a project for work to help with organizing data for a restructured phone system and an educational project for designing web pages using strictly vanilla Javascript.

## Installation and Running

1. Clone the project to your local computer `git clone https://github.com/DSSzymanski/WebDirectory.git`.
2. Open `WebDirectory/directory/directory.html` in your web browser.

## Reflection

This project's main purpose was to get some extra practice with using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Re-learing the syntax and structure for navigating the DOM was a good refresher in how to make dynamic web pages from scratch.
